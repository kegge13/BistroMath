# BistroMath
A general Radiotherapy profile and depth dose analysis tool

The BistroMath code is developed in Lazarus version 2.0.10 with (included) FreePascal compiler 3.0.4 as out-of-the-box compilable project.
First install Lazarus and then open the BistroMath.lpi project file in Lazarus.
It should also run with version 2.0.6 and 2.0.4, before was not tested.
Some specific libraries, in TOunits, are used but do not need any installation.
Therefore you can invoke Lazarus by opening the BistroMath.lpi project file. It should readily compile and run with pressing <F9>.
Note that there are several compiler modes. By default FPC will generate very large files.

For convenience the executable is written in the output directory.
