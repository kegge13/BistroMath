# BistroMath
A general Radiotherapy profile and depth dose analysis tool
The BistroMath code is developed in Lazarus version 2.0.10 with (included) FreePascal compiler 3.0.4 as out-of-the-box compilable project.
Some specific libraries, in TOunits, are used but do not need any installation.
Therefore you can invoke Lazarus by opening the BistroMath.lpi project file. It should readily compile and run with pressing <F9>.
Note that there are several compiler modes. By default FPC will generate very large files.

Output
For convenience the executable is written in the output directory.
