# BistroMath
A general Radiotherapy profile and depth dose analysis tool, written in FreePascal.

The predecessor of BistroMath started in 2005 as pure frustration of the limited performance of commercial (water phantom) scanning software. It has been contiuously growing over the years on the Delphi7 platform, which was good enough.
The current BistroMath code is developed in Lazarus version 2.0.10 with (included) FreePascal compiler 3.0.4 as out-of-the-box compilable project.
First install Lazarus and then open the BistroMath.lpi project file in Lazarus or invoke Lazarus by opening the BistroMath.lpi project file.
It should also run with version 2.0.6 and 2.0.4, before was not tested. It should readily compile and run with pressing F9.
Some specific libraries, in TOunits, are used but do not need any installation.
Note that there are several compiler modes. For this project a DEBUG and RELEASE mode are defined.

For convenience the executable is written in the output directory.
